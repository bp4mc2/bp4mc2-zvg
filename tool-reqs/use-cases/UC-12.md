# UC-12 Add an ontology

*As [USER ROLE], I want to [USE CASE]*

It should be possible to enrich Zorgeloos Vastgoed taxonomy with other ontologies. E.g.: FOAF, DC, Schema.org or a tailor-made ontology. I.e. to state that a (subject) Hypotheekgever of a skos:Concept and foaf:Person type is, that takes a mortgage (predicate expressed by HDN-ontology as “neemtHypotheekAfBij”) at the (object) Hypotheeknemer of a skos:Concept and schema:Organization type . See graph representation above.
